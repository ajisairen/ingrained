A community app for local growers. \

## Our Idea
We decided to make a mobile application to foster local communities that grow and take care of plants. Inspired by the local farmers' market scene in and around Minneapolis, we thought connecting people through a shared interest of plants would create a strong community that can build each other up and share experiences.

## Features
### Marketplace
We created a marketplace page for people to buy and sell (or give away!) plants, gardening tools, and grown produce to other people in the local area. People will be able to browse the listings of what people around their location have, similar to Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. The listings also contain categories, which in the future would allow people to filter listings to focus on what they want (i.e. only looking for succulents or produce)!
### Forums
Our forum page has posts that other people in the user's area have written. It is a space where people can share all things gardening/farming, from plant identification to exchanging tips with others. Our goal with the forums is to foster deeper connections and allow for a welcoming community that new users who are just getting into plant caretaking will feel comfortable in. 
### Profile
A user's profile gives a view of all their active marketplace listings and forum posts. Users will be able to send friend requests and private messages to other users, in cases where they want to reach out to someone specifically, whether to foster a friendship or further inquire about a marketplace listing.

## Tech Stack
- Flutter
- FireBase
- Figma (for UI design)
- UML Diagrams

## What We're Proud of
- The idea we came up with for our app
- We learned how to use Flutter and FireBase in under 24 hours (None of us had any experience with them prior to the Hackathon)
- Creating a nice design and UI for our app that is simple and intuitive
- Getting all our planned pages to have MVP (or almost MVP) functionality
- Connecting our app's frontend to its backend database

## What We Can Improve
- Our app is far from complete, and still needs a lot more functionality before it can be considered a fully fledged app.
  - Needs the sell page and a "make a new post" page to allow users to create their own posts (currently if you try to make a post it just creates a post with default values and no ability for customization or editing). 
  - We can't store images in our database because it costs money and we're broke :(
- Have proper authentication to ensure user information security
- We probably could have tried to learn Flutter and FireBase beforehand to better prepare
